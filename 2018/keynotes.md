		  <p>Abstract:<br/>Walt Disney Animation Studios has a long history of animated storytelling, and while much has changed over the more than 8 decades of of filmmaking, there are core animation principles that are as significant in today’s 3D digital productions as they were in the early days. One such enduring principle of animation is the “Plausible Impossible”, which Walt described as taking something that is impossible and making it appear rational and acceptable. In this talk  I will go over some of the base tenets of this principle and illustrate the concept with example animations.  Achieving these highly art-directed results while maintaining plausibility is an even greater challenge in the highly complex worlds of  our digital films today. I will give examples from recent films of some tools and workflows we have developed to aid the artists in achieving these highly stylized results.</p>
