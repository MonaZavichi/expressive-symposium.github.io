## Aims and Scope

Expressive fuses three symposia centered on expressive aspects of computer graphics.

__Computational Aesthetics (CAe)__ bridges the analytic and synthetic by integrating aspects of computer science, philosophy, psychology, and the fine, applied & performing arts. It brings together individuals with technical experience of developing computer-based tools to solve aesthetic problems and people with artistic/design backgrounds who use these new tools.

__Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering (NPAR)__ refers to computational techniques for visual communication. Such techniques usually generate imagery and motion which is expressive, rather than photorealistic, although they may incorporate realistic elements.

__Sketch-Based Interfaces and Modeling (SBIM)__ provides a unique venue for researchers, students and practitioners interested in sketch-based techniques to interact with one another, share lessons learned, show new results and discuss open issues.

These symposia were first held jointly in 2011, and continue to be integrated under the Expressive umbrella.
