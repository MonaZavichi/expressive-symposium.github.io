All work must be previously unpublished. Production and Meta papers need not contain original research or results, but must make a substantive contribution to the knowledge in the field. Papers should be 8â€“10 pages in length (excluding citations). Papers longer than 10 pages must make a very significant contribution. Supplemental video and images may also be submitted. Research papers are reviewed double-blind and so must be anonymous when submitted. References to your own work should be made in the third person to maintain anonymity.

> Paper submission is electronic and will be enabled closer to the submission date.

## Paper formatting

Manuscripts must be written in English. They should follow the [ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines](http://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors), including a title page with an abstract, keywords, and a bibliography. For formatting, please use the ACM SIGGRAPH LaTeX class files. Microsoft Word templates for [Windows](http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acm_windows_word_template.zip) and Macintosh ([Office 2011](http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acm_mac_2011_word_template.zip)) are available, but LaTeX is preferred. Only PDF files will be accepted for your submission. Make sure that all fonts are embedded.

## Supplemental material

Supplemental material such as additional images or videos may be submitted as PDF or as a zipped archive (ZIP files) with a maximum size of 30 MB.

## Video Formatting

Videos should be a maximum of 5 minutes in length and contain either clearly spoken English audio or subtitles. Please ensure that a commonly available format and codec is used. Suggested video specifications are: MP4 container format, with H.264 video encoding and AAC audio encoding. Videos can be converted into this format using freely available tools, such as [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/). Make sure that the video plays with [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), which is available on most platforms.

## Proceedings

Accepted papers and general submissions (posters/demos/artworks) will be published as a single conference proceedings by the ACM and will be available online via the [ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org/). Papers will also be archived in the [Eurographics Digital Library](https://diglib.eg.org/).

## General Submissions

Posters, demos, and artworks should be submitted in PDF format as an extended abstract (2 or more pages). They should follow the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines described above. Rejected papers may be considered for the poster track.
