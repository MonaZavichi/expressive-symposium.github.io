## Expressive 2019 is officially co-located with Eurographics 2019!

We are officially co-located with Eurographics 2019 in Genoa. Expressive 2019 will start and end shortly before Eurographics 2019.

## Aims and Scope
{: .top2}

_Expressive_ fuses three symposia centered on expressive aspects of computer graphics.

__Computational Aesthetics (CAe)__ integrates the bridging aspects of computer science, philosophy, psychology, and the fine, applied & performing arts. CAe investigates both tools to enhance the expressiveness of fine and applied arts, as well as theoretical approaches that further our understanding of aesthetic evaluation, perception and meaning.

__Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering (NPAR)__ investigates computational techniques for visual communication. Such techniques usually focuses on imagery and motion which is expressive, rather than photorealistic, although they may incorporate realistic elements.

__Sketch-Based Interfaces and Modeling (SBIM)__ focuses on the exploration of models, algorithms, and technologies for efficient sketch-based interfaces. It investigates the classification and recognition of hand-drawn shapes, and ways of using these techniques for creating or editing digital models, text, mathematics or 3D shapes.

These symposia were first held jointly in 2011, and continue to be integrated under the _Expressive_ umbrella.
