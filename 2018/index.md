  <p>The second IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT 2014) builds upon the success of the first edition of VISSOFT in Eindhoven, which in turn followed after six editions of the IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis (VISSOFT) and five editions of the ACM Symposium on Software Visualization (SOFTVIS). In 2014, VISSOFT will again be co-located with ICSME in Victoria, BC, Canada.</p>

  <h3>Aims and Scope</h3>

  <p>Software Visualization is a broad research area encompassing techniques that assist in a range of software engineering activities, such as, specification, design, programming, testing, maintenance, reverse engineering and reengineering. Covered methods contain the development and evaluation of approaches for visually analyzing software and software systems, including their structure, execution behavior, and evolution.</p>

  <p>In this conference, we focus on visualization techniques that target aspects of software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and reengineering, i.e., how visualization helps programmers to understand, analyze, and evolve software. We aim to gather tool developers, users and researchers from software engineering, information visualization, and human-computer interaction to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. We seek theoretical, as well as practical papers on applications, techniques, tools, case studies, and empirical studies.</p>
